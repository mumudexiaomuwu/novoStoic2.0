## Remaining data can be taken from the scholarsphere psu link [here](https://doi.org/10.26207/fxd2-se27)
Due to constraints of file sizes on github, we have published all the data and codes on shcholar sphere psu.

## creating conda environment
- create a conda environment using: `conda create --prefix pathwaydesign`
- activate the created environment using: `conda activate pathwaydesign`
- install rdkit using: `pip install rdkit` 
- install streamlit using: `pip install streamlit`

## Steps to run streamlit interface locally

run the following on terminal after activating the conda environment `streamlit run Home.py`
